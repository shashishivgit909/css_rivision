## For css flex box : Go this docs: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/   (recommneded by chai with code).


## Default Flex Direction
    Default Value: row
    Effect: Flex items are arranged in a row, starting from the left.
    Nested Flex Containers
    When you have a parent flex container and a child that is also a flex container, the flex-direction property of the parent does not affect the flex-direction property of the child. Each flex container has its own independent set of flex properties.



## Transition Property:   (By Shradha didi)
=> Elements have different states (eg: active , hover   we can see it in inspect). 


## VVI : Margin Note: 
1. 
{
    width: 70%;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

=> By margin: auto in left right (above ): Browser first calculate the space avaliable in width and then it divides the remaining space equally as left and right margin so element comes in centre.

2.  Whem we give margin then element  make seperation  either from parent of siblings both . if a div is inside a a div and give margin  to inner div to 20px then  it takes  seperation from  parent div . if gives margin negative value it comes outside of that parent div and takes that specified outside that parent div .
