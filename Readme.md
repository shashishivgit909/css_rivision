## For css flex box : Go this docs: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/   (recommneded by chai with code).


## Default Flex Direction
    Default Value: row
    Effect: Flex items are arranged in a row, starting from the left.
    Nested Flex Containers
    When you have a parent flex container and a child that is also a flex container, the flex-direction property of the parent does not affect the flex-direction property of the child. Each flex container has its own independent set of flex properties.
